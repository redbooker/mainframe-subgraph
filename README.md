# Mainframe Subgraph

Mainframe is a fixed-rate lending protocol build on the Ethereum blockchain. This subgraph indexes the events
emitted by our smart contracts.

You can interact with the subgraph via The Graph's [hosted
service](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/redbooker/mainframe).

## Queries

Below are a few ways to show how to query the Mainframe Subgraph for data. The queries show most of the information
that is queryable, but there are many other filtering options that can be used, just check out the querying api.

You can also see the saved queries on the hosted service for examples.
